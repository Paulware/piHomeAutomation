   <H1>Device List</h1>
   When you create a new sd card, all the devices that had been previously added to your system will be forgotten<br>
   So before you wipe out your old sd card, run a php program named: <br>
      actionsSnapshot.php<br>
   To capture the prevous devices (on the old system): <br>
   <ul>
      <li>Power up your old pi with the old devices</li>
      <li>Connect to its wifi accesspoint if it has it</li>
      <li>From the browser execute the url/command: <br>
             http://192.168.4.1/Paulware/actionsSnapshot.php</li>
      <li>This will create the .php file: restoreSnapshot.php</li>
      <li>Using winscp, copy this file to your new sd card, boot directory</li>
      <li>Power up the new sd card, in a raspberry pi</li>
      <li>Using winscp copy the restoreSnapshot.php from the boot directory to the /var/www/html/Paulware directory</li>
      <li>Using a browser, run restoreShapshot.php by opening the url: <br>
             http://192.168.4.1/Paulware/restoreSnapshot.php<br>
             Your devices should now reappear
      </li>
   </ul>
   Note: if your old pi does not have a wifi access point available you will need to change 192.168.4.1 to whatever ip address the pi is located on your lan.
